# Invio — Hack Club Summer of Making

Self-hosted invoicing without the bloat. Fast, transparent, and fully yours.

Hey! I’m building Invio because I was tired of invoice tools that felt like mini-CRMs. I just want to make an invoice, share a link, and get paid—without vendor lock‑in or a dashboard full of things I don’t need. Invio is my take: lightweight, self-hosted, and focused on doing the job.

## Try it
- Live demo: https://invio-demo.codingkitten.hackclub.app  
- Demo login: `demo / demo`

## What Invio does (right now)
- Create an invoice quickly without “project” or “CRM” overhead
- Share a secure public link with clients (no account needed to view)
- Keep your data where you run it, and export it when you want
- Simple, fast experience built to stay out of your way

## Why I’m building this
- Built for doing, not configuring — create an invoice, send a link, get paid. No bloat in your way.
- You really own it — self‑hosted by default. Your data lives where you put it, and exporting is always an option.
- Fast & dependable — Deno + Fresh on the frontend, Hono + SQLite on the backend.
- Client‑friendly — share a view‑only link with everything they need.

## How it’s built
- Frontend: Deno + Fresh
- Backend: Hono
- Database: SQLite

This stack keeps it lean, portable, and easy to run on small hardware or cheap hosting.

## Host it yourself
Invio is designed to be self‑hosted from day one. Setup instructions live here:
